\f0\fs24 \cf0 Welcome To TipToTax\
\
This basic program is my intro to Mobile Development in Android Studio. \
\
Here you will see a basic made application that allows you to enter any website - Not to worry the link works actively. \
\
Once you have found the total of your bill you can enter the amount before tax and email to anyone using your built in email client, \
\
Not to worry the Application will automatically recognize whatever email client you are using. T\
\
his was also an introduction to mobile design so lots of the elements interms of UI are hard coded in. This project was built as part of a group with Professor Lou Nel at Carleton University. \
\
When running the project please be sure to clean the project and rebuild before running or you will get errors\
\
If you have any questions please feel free to email me imran.juma@carleton.ca \
